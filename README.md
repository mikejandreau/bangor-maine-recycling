## Usage

After downloading/extracting, run `npm install` and then run `npm start` which will open up a preview in your default browser, watch for changes to core template files, and live reload the browser when changes are saved. You can view the `gulpfile.js` to see which tasks are included with the dev environment.

#### Main Gulp Tasks

- `gulp` the default task that builds everything
- `gulp watch` browserSync opens the project in your default browser and live reloads when changes are made

You must have npm and Gulp installed globally on your machine in order to use these features.
